# Dark Matter as Non-Aggregative Matter: A Hypothesis

## Abstract 

The existence of dark matter has been widely accepted by the scientific community as a necessary component to explain the observed gravitational effects in the universe. However, its nature and origin remain largely unknown. In this article, we propose a hypothesis that dark matter was generated alongside regular baryonic matter during the early universe, but has less density than the critical density for matter to aggregate. Therefore, dark matter is a non-aggregative matter that does not form structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies in the same sense of baryonic matter. We provide evidence from various observations that support our hypothesis.

## Introduction 

The standard model of cosmology assumes that the universe is composed of both baryonic matter and dark matter. Baryonic matter includes all the familiar elements we observe in our everyday lives, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons, while dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is inferred to exist based on its gravitational effects on visible matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The critical density is the density required for the universe to be flat, and is estimated to be approximately 9.35 x 10^-27 kg/m^3 [1]. The critical density for matter to aggregate is the density at which the universe is flat and the expansion rate is just enough to counteract the gravitational attraction of matter. This density is estimated to be about 5 atoms per cubic meter. Matter that is above this critical density would still form structures, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. However, it would eventually collapse under the force of gravity and form structures such as supermassive blackholes [11] [12]. 

The nature and origin of dark matter remain largely unknown, and various hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. In this article, we propose a new hypothesis that dark matter was generated alongside regular baryonic matter during the early universe, but has less density than the critical density for matter to aggregate. Therefore, dark matter is a non-aggregative matter that does not form structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

## Evidence for Non-Aggregative Dark Matter

Our hypothesis is supported by various observations. For example, simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies show that dark matter plays a crucial role in their structure and dynamics [3] [4]. However, these simulations[6] assume that dark matter behaves in a baryonic matter-like model, which is known to aggregate and form structures. On the other hand, *Tulin and Yu* suggest that dark-matter may interact with itself not only in a gravitational way, but in some other hidden force [5].

Observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) also support our hypothesis. The CMB is the oldest light in the universe, and it provides a snapshot of the universe when it was only 380,000 years old. The CMB shows small fluctuations in temperature that correspond to variations in the density of matter in the early universe. These fluctuations are consistent with the predictions of the standard model of cosmology, which assumes that dark matter behaves like baryonic matter. However, our hypothesis predicts that dark matter should not show these fluctuations, since it does not aggregate like baryonic matter [7] [8].

Furthermore, observations of the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe also support our hypothesis. The distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies on large scales is thought to be determined by the distribution of dark matter. However, recent observations have shown that the large-scale distribution of matter is more homogeneous than predicted by simulations that assume dark matter behaves like baryonic matter. Our hypothesis explains this discrepancy by positing that dark matter does not form structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies. [9] [10].

## Supermassive Black Holes as an extremely Aggregative Matter

Extremely aggregative matter and supermassive black holes are believed to form through the collapse of large amounts of baryonic matter under the force of gravity. This collapse occurs when the density of the matter exceeds a certain critical density, known as the Chandrasekhar limit, which is approximately 1.4 times the mass of the Sun per cubic kilometer [13]. When the density of the matter exceeds this limit, the pressure generated by the thermal motions of the particles is no longer sufficient to counteract the force of gravity. The matter collapses in on itself, forming a highly compact object known as a neutron star or, in the case of even larger masses, a black hole.

Supermassive and ultramassive black holes are thought to form through the collapse of extremely dense matter in the early universe. According to the standard model of cosmology, small density fluctuations in the early universe led to the formation of dark matter halos, which subsequently merged to form larger structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Within these structures, gas can accumulate and eventually collapse under its own gravity, forming stars that can subsequently collapse to form black holes. However, recent simulations suggest that massive black hole seeds may have formed directly from the collapse of extremely dense gas clouds that formed soon after the Big Bang. These clouds could have had masses ranging from tens to millions of solar masses, and their collapse would have been triggered by gravitational instability. The resulting black holes would have had masses ranging from tens to billions of solar masses and could have served as seeds for the formation of supermassive and ultramassive black holes observed in the centers of galaxies today [12].

## Basis for Spectrum like Matter Formation

The Big Bang theory posits that the universe began as an incredibly hot and dense state, expanding and cooling over time. As it cooled, particles began to form and combine, eventually leading to the formation of atoms and, eventually, stars and galaxies. The process of particle formation occurred over a wide range of energy scales, from the highest-energy particles in the early universe to the low-energy particles we observe today. The spectrum of energy and density ranges from the extremely high energies of cosmic rays to the low-energy photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The Big Bang also generated dark matter and dark energy, which are thought to make up the majority of the matter and energy in the universe. The vast range of energy and density scales involved in the Big Bang and its aftermath is a testament to the complexity and richness of the universe [14] [15].

## Conclusion

In this article, we have proposed a hypothesis that dark matter was generated alongside regular baryonic matter during the early universe, but has less density than the critical density for matter to aggregate. Therefore, dark matter is a non-aggregative matter that does not form structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies in the same way as baryonic matter. We have provided reviews from various observations that support our hypothesis, and we believe that our hypothesis offers a new perspective on the nature and origin of dark matter and supermassive black holes. Future observations and simulations may provide further support or falsification of our hypothesis.
